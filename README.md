# Warehouse website: Show image caption on Hover

This is the repo of a simple solution I found working on the Hartman website. 
The problem was how to create a hover state showing the image caption using Divi builder?
Divi has some options using galleries but the client requested to use single images instead.

# Solution

I added the images using HTML code on the text modules, the rest is done with a simple CSS code
